# Mini Solveur SMT #

Mini Solveur SMT pour le cours de
[Sémantique et Vérification](http://www.di.ens.fr/~rival/semverif-2018/)
avec [Sylvain Conchon](https://www.lri.fr/~conchon/) (ENS Paris)

## Getting started ##

### Prerequisites ###

This project has been conducted using the
[Crystal Programming Language](https://crystal-lang.org/).

Its syntax is very similar to Ruby, but it is statically type-checked
and compiled through [LLVM](https://llvm.org/), offering performances similar to C.

Instructions regarding the installation of the Crystal Programming Language
can be found on the [official documentation](https://crystal-lang.org/docs/installation/).

It is, as of this writing, not available for Windows though.

### Installation ###

You can now build and run the unit tests with

```
make
```

Or, alternatively, only build or run the automated unit tests with

```
make build
make test
```
